### Assumptions
- Different phases of a vid cover X secs, so a client will fetch different phases of a video after every X secs
- Each client has a session_id and user_id of the requester
- If a session doesnt request for the next phase of a video after X secs, It will be considered idle
- Sessions idle for n*X secs will be expired, and active stream sessions reduced by that number

- user_id = string type

end_point_1 (Called by a Client) - get active endpoint
    Query every X Secs
        Check # of active sessions, 
            if session_id in active-sessions:
                update last_activity_date and return True
            else:
                if <= 3:                
                    return True, and trigger a Call Back (to allow stream) -> should return stream session_id and user-id
                        if successful:
                            Register Session in Redis:
                                Properties being:
                                    session_id
                                    user_id
                                    last_activity_date/time
                            
                                    # key -> [ user_id | session_id ]

end_point_2: (Triggered by a lambda function) - to Expire Inactive sessions:
    Fetch all sessions with last_activity_date_time <= n*X
        expire all of them (call back)
